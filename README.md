# -Fetal-Health-Prediction-Comparative-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Models
Developed a web-based machine learning system to predict fetal health conditions using clinical data. The objective was to support early diagnosis and improve decision-making in prenatal care. The project involved comprehensive preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation.
Key highlights:

Used ensemble methods, specifically Bagging Classifier, for enhanced accuracy and robustness

Integrated Django to deploy the ML model as a user-interactive web application

Performed extensive data visualization and preprocessing using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

Achieved high classification performance across health conditions: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological
